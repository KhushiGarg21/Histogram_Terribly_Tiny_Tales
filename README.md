Histogram Assignment

First You'll see a "Submit" button. Clicking on it, will fetch the contents of my "data" text file, parse the content to find the frequency of occurrence of each word, and display a histogram of the 20 most occurring words.
Additionally, you can click the "Export" button to download a CSV file of the histogram data.

I used mapping to get each word(which comes under in 20 most occuring words).
Through the "Bar" component which I imported from "react-chartjs-2" module, i set the data, under which i mentioned all the properties like "labels", "datasets", "options".
Then You will see the "export" button, whose functioning comes under the "handleExport" function.
